The tab _Calculation Engine_ is the main entrypoint for the selection of the metrics. Howering over the elements shows additional information identically to parts of the M_etric Explorer_. Checking the box on the right enables the calculation of all metrics of a given category. However, it is also possible to add further, isolated metrics by clicking on the metric items. The button *"Already Calculated"* shows the repositories which metrics are already in the database. These repositories can be a starting point for further exploration.

A click on the arrow starts the metric request. If the metric is not yet stored in the system, the application asks to put the calculation task into the queue. If it is already in the queue, a notification informs on the progress. As soon as the data is completely analyzed, a click on the arrow leads to the metric results presented as a paginated table, representing the metric values along the different ontology versions. The drop down menu in the header allows for the selection of the various ontology metrics, the download button exports the metrics of the file into a .csv.
