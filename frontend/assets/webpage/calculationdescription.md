The tab _Calculation Engine_ is the main entry point for the selection of the metrics. Hovering over the elements shows additional information identically to parts of the Metric Explorer. By checking the box on the right, a user enables the calculation of all metrics of a given category. However, adding other singular metrics by clicking on the metric items is also possible. The _"Already Calculated"_ button shows the repositories whose metrics are already in the database. These repositories can be a starting point for further exploration.

A click on the arrow starts the metric request. If the metric is not yet stored in the system, the application asks to put the calculation task into the queue. If it is already in the queue, a notification informs of the progress. Once the data is analyzed, a click on the arrow leads to the metric results presented as a paginated table, representing the measured values along the different ontology versions. The drop-down menu in the header allows for selecting the various ontology metrics. The download button exports the metrics into a .csv. Further, the _update_ icon puts the repository or file into the queue again to retrieve the newest commits or recalculate the ontology location.
