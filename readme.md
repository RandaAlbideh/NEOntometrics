# NEOntometrics Ontology Calculation software

Welcome to **NEOntometrics**. It offers a flexible endpoint for calculating ontology metrics online, either directly from an online ressource or a git-based repository. 
You can use the service online on neontometrics.com, or visit api.informatik.uni-rostock.de for the GraphQL api.

The scientific papers that further describe the service are currently under review. As soon as they are accepted, we will provide them here as well.
