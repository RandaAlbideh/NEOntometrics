# ontoMetrics


Semantic skills offer powerful tools for integration, analysis, generation and Coding knowledge. Knowledge comes in the form of ontologies, taxonomies and vocabularies and can help to find new knockledge. Ontologies have to meet different requirements and quality characteristics depending on the intended use.
One way of evaluating Ontologies is to calculate Ontologie metrics, which can correlate with quality characteristics like comprehensibility, reusability, modularity and development. This is where ontoMetrics can be used to validate and display statistics of a given Ontologie source.
